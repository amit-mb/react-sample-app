A simple react app that includes a increment and decrement button with initial count set to 0. You can either increment or decrement the given number.

The purpose of ths app is to learn how to start development process with react environment.

**How-TO**

- Assuming node and npm LTS version installed in you machine, install create-react-app globally by entering `npm i -g create-react-app`

- Use the create-react-app package to create the proper folder structure and configs by entering `create=react-app AppName`

-Run the app by typing `npm start`

- Open the project in your faourite code editor - `code .` or `subl .` or whatever

- Go to `src` folder. You will notice several files such as 
    - `App.css`  to style `App.js`
    - `index.css` to style `index.js`
    - `logo.svg` for the favicon. Use you own

- Make you changes in `App` Component by editing `App.js`    

- Notice the following at top of `App.js` and infer what they import and why
```
import React, { Component } from 'react';
//import logo from './logo.svg';
import './App.css';
```

- Make changes as needed. Add more components and import them into `App.js` as you need. Be creative

- In case the process isn't running, run it by entering `npm start`
